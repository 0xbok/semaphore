# Contracts

When using Semaphore contracts keep in mind that there are two types of contracts:

- **Base contracts**: they allow you to use the main protocol features (i.e. verify a proof or manage Merkle trees/groups).
- **Extension contracts**: they contain application logic and could be used for specific use-cases (e.g. anonymous voting).

Our current available extension contracts can be a good example of how base contracts can be used.
